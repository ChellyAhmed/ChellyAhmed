## Hi ^_^!

I'm Ahmed Chelly.
I'm a passionate software developer from Tunisia.

I like using React.js for Web Development and React Native for Mobile Development. But I'm always interested in discovering and using new technologies.

I enjoy solving competitive programming problems, and to do so I usually use Python.

## The projects I'm proud of the most are:
[Chelly](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/Chelly): My personal portfolio website created using ReactJs

[Roommie](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/roommie): A roommate matching platform created using ReactJs, an ExpressJs server, and a SQL Database

[ModernCoffee](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/modernCoffee): A smart coffee mug project that tracks data about the coffee through various sensors, analyzes it, and provides insights on a dashboard accessible online.
