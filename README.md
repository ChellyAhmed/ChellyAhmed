## Hi!

I'm Ahmed Chelly.
I'm a passionate software developer from Tunisia.

🚀 I thrive on building awesome things with technology.

💻 My favorite (old) projects are:

- [Chelly](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/Chelly): My personal portfolio website created using ReactJs
- [Roommie](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/roommie): A roommate matching platform created using ReactJs, an ExpressJs server, and a SQL Database
- [Mastermind](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/mastermind): A knowledge-based AI Agent developed with Python to play the game Mastermind on console.
- [QuizGame](https://github.com/ChellyAhmed/quizGame/): A console-based trivia quiz game that can be played between multiple hosts at the same time connected via sockets, entirely coded with Python.

🧠 I also enjoy solving competitive programming problems and to do so, I usually use Python.

🌐 Feel free to explore my projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. Let's connect and build something amazing together!

⚡ Fun fact: I have a deep appreciation for open-source software, and I'm proud to have contributed to Bootstrap, my favorite front-end framework.

Happy coding! ✨
